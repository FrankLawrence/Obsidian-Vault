Here are some sample project reports from the previous years to give you some idea of what is expected. The requirements change from year to year, so make sure you carefully read theÂ [Project requirements and rubric](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/pages/project-requirements-and-rubric "Project requirements and rubric"). The reports are in no particular order and vary in difficulty.

You are encouraged to experiment and should not be afraid to attempt more difficult tasks (do make sure you do not take on more than you can handle, the purpose of the project is to get you started in the Machine Learning field, not to demoralize you). If you choose something harder like CNNs and Deep Learning, even if you do not get the best results, as long as you properly structure your report, document the steps you went through and take an honest approach in your conclusions, you should still get a good grade.
