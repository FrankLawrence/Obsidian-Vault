## Questions related to the book chapters 1 and 2

**Question 6. Direct manipulation  
**The characteristics of direct manipulation include visibility of objects, incremental action, rapid feedback, reversibility, exploration, syntactic correctness of all actions, and replacing language with action. For each characteristic consider and discuss an example task performed with modern GUIs. Contrast the task with the same task as performed in a command-line environment such as Microsoft PowerShell or a linux or MacOS Terminal with bash shell.  
(question from MacKenzie, I. S. (2013). Human-computer interaction : An empirical research perspective. Elsevier Science & Technology.)

**Question 7a. Reaction times**

Conduct within your group a small experiment on human reaction time using the [https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/java/redgreen.htmlLinks to an external site.](https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/java/redgreen.html)  website provided on this book’s website. Recruit at least 3 participants. Describe the outcome of the experiment. Include some factors that may have influenced the reaction time. 

**Question 7b. Adaptation (100-200 words)  
**Consider modifying the software in some way, to conduct a different reaction type experiment (for example name matching), found in Section 2.7.1. Describe the adaptations and the new experiment that could be done.

**Question 4. (200-400 words)**

Conduct a small experiment on panning and zooming using Google Street View. Devise three tasks and measure users’ performance using different input methods (e.g., keyboard versus mouse or touchpad versus mouse). As an example task, see Figure 3.9a in the book. For this example, a reasonable (single) task is to pan and zoom to the clock tower (right side of image), determine the time on the clock, then pan and zoom back to the starting position. User performance may be measured in a variety of ways, such as task completion time, accuracy in the final scene position, number of steps or corrective actions, etc. Use 3-5 participants. Write a brief report on your observations and measurements.

-Include a (possible) interaction error as described in chapter 3 in the book in the report that you encountered during the experiment.

## Questions related to the book chapters 4 and 5

**Question 4a:** Give one example of a HCI experimental research paper where an _independent variable was assigned between-subjects_.  Provide a link to the paper, description of the variables and briefly describe the rationale.

**Question 4b:** Find an example of an HCI paper describing a _longitudinal study_. (Preferably, find an example not cited in this book.) Provide a link to the paper, description of the testing procedure the study setup (between, within), identify the main independent variable (and levels) and discuss how it was administered and briefly describe the rationale.

**Question 3**

The following data are from a hypothetical experiment comparing texting speeds on a mobile phone while sitting versus walking. Eight participants were tested.

Instead of counterbalancing, learning effects were offset by administering a practice session before testing. Perform an ANOVA on the data to determine if there is a difference in texting speed while sitting or walking. Write a brief report on your findings (100-200 words).

**Question 4**

A researcher is interested in investigating whether Mac or PC users differ in their habits for using “wallpaper” on their desktop. (Wallpaper is a personalized background graphic.) A number of users on a university campus were approached and asked to provide two items of information. First, they were asked whether their main system was a Mac or PC. Second, they were asked about their wallpaper habits and, in particular, whether they (a) did not use wallpaper, (b) used personalized wallpaper but changed it less than once per month ( < 12 times in the last year), or (c) used personalized wallpaper and changed it more than once per month. The responses to the latter were coded as “none,” “wallpaper static,” and “wallpaper dynamic,” respectively. The results are shown in the table below. Each cell contains the number of users in each category:

Perform a chi-square test on the data above to determine if Mac or PC users differ in their wallpaper habits. Write a brief report on your findings (100-200 words).
