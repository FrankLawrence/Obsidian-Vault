# Thought Experiments
> [!example] Class game
> You all get 10Â£.
> I'll pass around an envelope and do an offer: Any money that you'll put in the envelope will be collected. Then I'll double the given amount. Finally, I'll split the total among all of you.
# Contractualism's solution
- Moral theories are systematizations: They tell a general story on why it's okay to intervene in certain cases, but not in others
- Moral theories can be used to resolve moral dilemmas in a systematic and intelligent way
- Two types of egoism:
	- Psychological egoism: People are egoistic by nature
	- Ethical egoism: People may/should act from self-interest
- *Paradox*: following one's self-interest is not in one's self-interest -> Ethical egoism is self-defeating

| Pro Contractualism                                                | Contra Contractualism                  |

| Thin starting-point: self-interest (appealing to ethical egoists) | Certain people/groups can't benefit me |
| Can solve the tragedy of the commons                              |                                        |
| Can explain much of commonsense morality/legislation              |                                        |
| Can explain why bad/discriminatory laws should not be obeyed      |                                        |

Two conditions to check:
1. Do I benefit?
2. Do I have assurance that others will cooperate too?
# Self-driving cars
- Tragedy of the "algorithmic" commons:
	- No one wants a self-driving car that may sacrifice them
	- Everyone want others to drive self-driving cars that minimize total harm - and so may sacrifice the driver
