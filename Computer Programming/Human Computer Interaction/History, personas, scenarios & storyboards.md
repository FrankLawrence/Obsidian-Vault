# Communicating Requirements and Design Concepts
- Personas:
	- Fictional characters
	- Communicate the needs of the users
	- Are helpful in the design process
	- Do not design for the average user, but differentiate and create a set of *typical* users
	- Personas are representative for the target audience, but they are NOT average!

> [!example] Designing different cars for different people with different specific goals

- Scenarios:
	- A written story that explains how a person, or multiple persons, will use an interactive system
	- Goals: Describes situations at many levels of detail
	- Excellent starting point for design activities
	- *Usability issues* can be explored at an early stage in the design process
	- Encourages user-centred design approach
