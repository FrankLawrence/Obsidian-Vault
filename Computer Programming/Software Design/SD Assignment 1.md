# Project pitch

The project pitch, i.e., Assignment 1 is a slide deck containing the following:

- A description of your version of the system you are going to design and implement during the remainder of the course. Your project always starts from one of the tracks described at the beginning of this document, but of course you can be creative and customize your project according to your taste. Here, you need to clearly specify which are the key aspects of your system, such as the customizations/extensions w.r.t. the project track description, the main type(s) of users, etc.
- The description of each functional feature of your system. All the features reported here will be modeled and implemented in Assignments 2 and 3, respectively. 

The project pitch will be 
1. submitted by February 16 at 23:59 and 
2. *discussed by the team with their mentor during the next weekly meeting.*
