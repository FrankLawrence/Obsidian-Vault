Consider the following operations on common containers. What are their time complexities? Why? NOTE: **you must specify the underlying data structure** you assume for these containers. Different underlying structures may result in different complexities.

1. Inserting an element at the tail of a queue
2. Removing an element at the head of a queue
3. Popping an element from a stack
4. Pushing an element onto a stack
5. Inserting an element in a set
6. Deleting an element from a set
