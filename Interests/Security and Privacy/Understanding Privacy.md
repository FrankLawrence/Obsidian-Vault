# Privacy: A Concept in Disarray
Nobody can explain what it really means, there have been attempts at defining it. 
It has different meanings: 
- control over your body
- freedom of thought
- **control over personal information**
- freedom from surveillance
- protection of reputation
We need to know what privacy is, before we can start making laws. People can't conceptualise what they risk to loose when their privacy is threatened and taken away.
# Technology and the Rising Concern over Privacy
Since the development of new technologies, people have become concerned about their privacy. Privacy is under attack and is slowly dying out. Some say that in the near future, privacy will not exist anymore. 
> Privacy, it seems, is not simply dead. It is dying over and over again
> - Professor Deborah Nelson

People care about privacy in the abstract, but give out personal information willingly. People's privacy concerns diverge from what they do.
Privacy is the "power to conceal information about themselves that others might use to their (the individuals) disadvantage" (Judge Richard Posner)
# The Concept of Privacy
![[Privacy Violations examples]]
Privacy problems are often wrongly interpreted in the law. 
> Like the emotive word “freedom,” “privacy” means so many different things to so many different people that it has lost any precise legal connotation that it might once have had.
