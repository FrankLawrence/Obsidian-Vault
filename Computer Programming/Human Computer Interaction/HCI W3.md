# Part 1: study design
## Question 1a
Describe the aspects of the user experience that you study by providing, from the user's point of view, an informal description of the goals of the experiment (~150words)Â 

- Aspects of the user experience: 
	- Efficiency: Task completion time
	- Accuracy: Error rate (how many times they mis-click out of all clicks)
	- Use questionnaire (happiness of the user)
- **Goal**: To see if the UI is intuitive and usable (if they can locate things easily, and perform the tasks easily)
---
- We will have three users that will perform 3 tasks on 3 seperate interaction devices (independent variable): Trackpad, mouse, phone
	- The first interaction device will be different for all participants to minimize the *first-time* confounding variable
	- The tasks for each of the users will also be in random order
## Question 1b
Provide a description of the study protocol that you have used in the experiment (~150 words)*
- Frank: Explains the overview/study
- Melisa and Patrick: Keep track of the times separately
- Melisa: Tech support
- Nika: Keeps track of accuracy and reads tasks
- Patrick: Explains things on the questionnaire if there are any questions

1. Choosing the participants
2. Frank welcomes the participants and explain the app
3. Frank will assign the person with an interaction device. The first interaction device will be different for each user
4. Nika will tell the tasks to complete (tasks written down and read off)
	1. Melisa and Patrick will simultaneously start the timers
	2. Nika will keep track of how many miss-clicks there are
5. parts 3 and 4 will be repeated for the rest of the interaction devices
6. Patrick will give each person a questionnaire
## Question 1c
What are the independent and dependent variables in your user experiments? Explain for each, how you measured or used in your experiment (~150words)

| Independent        | Dependent             |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| interaction device | task completion speed |
| interaction device | accuracy              |
| Experience         | Learnability          |
|                    |                       |
# Part 2: study result
## Question 2a
Provide a narrative report on the user study (~200 words)
## Question 2b
Provide a structured result, including an analysis in the form of a table, graph, or other synthesis of the result
# Part 3: reflection
## Question 3a
Reflect on how valid (the outcome of) your experiment is. How representative is the low-fidelity prototype, the setting and the user group wrt your target users (~150 words)

Confound variables:
- Environment (loud or quiet)
- Age -> are familiar/accustomed to the interaction devices
- Parts of the app not implemented
	- task completion celebration
	- repeating tasks
	
- Each user hasn't seen the application yet

## Question 3b
How will the results of the study be used to improve the prototype? (~150 words)

*) if you updated your lo-fi prototype since the previous week, please provide the updated one here as well
