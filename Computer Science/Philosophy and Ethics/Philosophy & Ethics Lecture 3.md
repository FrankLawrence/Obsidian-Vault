Order of tragedy of the algorithmic commons:
1. Others cooperate, but I don't
2. We all cooperate
3. No one cooperates
4. I cooperate, but others don't

Contractualist solution: I'lll cooperate - drive an automatic car that minimizes total harm and so might sacrifice me - on the condition that others cooperate too.

| Contractualism      | Utilitarism               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| What's best for me? | What's best for everyone? | 

| Hedonism                                                              | Desire Satisfaction                                           | Objective list theory                                                         |

| Well-being: pleasure is what counts.                                  | Well-being: when you get what you want.                       | Well-being: health, education, achievement, friendship, freedom, safety, etc. |
| Your life goes better the more pleasure you have, and less suffering. | Your life goes better the more of your desires are satisfied. | Your life goes better the more things you have from this list.                |
