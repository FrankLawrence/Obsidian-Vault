# Modeling

In the modelling part of your project, i.e., Assignment 2, you provide a set of UML models of your system, together with a detailed description of the design decisions you made when constructing the models, which alternatives you evaluated, how you shaped the problem and its solution, etc. We expect at least the following models in Assignment 2:
- 1 complete package diagram for representing the main groups of classes within your system;
- 1 class diagram presenting all classes of your system;
- at least 2 state machine diagrams for representing the behavior of the entities of your system with a relevant abstract behavior;
- at least 2 sequence diagrams, each of them representing how objects communicate during a moment of system execution that is particularly relevant for understanding;
- [*optional*] 1 object diagram for representing one snapshot of the system at run-time that is particularly relevant for understanding. This diagram is not mandatory, but providing one of at least decent quality will give a small bonus.

**IMPORTANT**: The models in your Assignment 2 will be descriptive, i.e., they will describe the main entities within your system, their high-level relationships, their high-level behaviour. Differently, the models in your Assignment 3 will be prescriptive, i.e., they will contain all relevant implementation-specific details (e.g., classes with “technical purposes” that are not part of the domain of the system, all method calls among objects in a specific scenario, etc.).

If needed, additional models can be included in the report, such as component diagrams, activity diagrams, etc. The presence of those models will be considered as a bonus while grading the project. Diagrams.net will be used in the laboratory sessions of this course, but teams are free to use any tool among the following ones:

- Diagrams.net (graphical, free, web-based, but no checks on the correctness of the models)
- Eclipse Papyrus (graphical, free and open-source)
- PlantUML (textual, free, open-source, web- and desktop-based)
- JetUML (graphical, free, open-source, desktop-based)
- UMLetino (graphical, free, web-based, but no checks on the correctness of the models)
- Modelio (graphical, free and open-source)
- StarUML (graphical, commercial, evaluation version available with watermarks on models)
- MagicDraw (graphical, commercial, trial version available)

**IMPORTANT**: for the sake of consistency, each member of a certain team must use the same UML modeling tool for Assignments 2 and 3, i.e., Assignment 2 locks in the tool choice.
