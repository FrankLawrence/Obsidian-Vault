`1, 6, 3, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`

## Pseudocode first sequence
```
value := firstElement //firstElement is in the case of the sequence either 1, 5, or -3
//check if n is bigger than 0
if n <= 0 then
	return error
//loop for n amount of times
for i := 1 to n do
	//If the value is even, divide by two
	if value % 2 == 0 then
		value := value / 2
	//Else multiply by 5 and add 1
	else
		value := value * 5 + 1
	i := i + 1 //increment i by 1
return value //returns the n-th element 
```
## Problem exploration
Since the problem didn't mention that the same rule must apply to all numbers, I looked at what rule applies to which selection of numbers. In the first sequence it became fairly obvious, that even numbers are divided by two (16, 8, 4, 2). Now that I knew this rule, I still had to deduce what operations are used on odd numbers. After examining the first three values, I found that the preceding values all were close multiples of 5. I then concluded that odd numbers are multiplied by 5 and incremented by one.
