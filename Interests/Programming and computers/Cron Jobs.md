Cron is one of the most useful utility that you can find in any Unix-like operating system. Cron is used to schedule commands at a specific time. These scheduled commands or tasks are known as "Cron Jobs". Cron is generally used for running scheduled backups, monitoring disk space, deleting files (for example log files) periodically which are no longer required, running system maintenance tasks and a lot more.
