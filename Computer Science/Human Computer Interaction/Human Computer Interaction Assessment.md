Your final grade will be a mix of the average assignment grade, and final exam (on campus in Week 8):

          **Final Grade = 0.6 x Assignment + 0.4 x Exam**

To pass the course, students need to pass both parts (average assignment grade >= 5.5, exam grade >= 5.5).  
  
There are seven weekly group assignments that together make a group project. The first six weekly assignments are graded on 50 points, the final assignment is 100 points. The assignment grade is the final score/40. Several [themes are proposed for the group project](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/75700/pages/themes-for-group-projects), but you are also welcome to choose your own use case.

The groups are formed by the students themselves, in 2 steps. Step (1) Check the TA/Group schedule above to find the time slots options that suit you. Find the group numbers that correspond to your time slot options. Step (2) Open the Canvas page for registering your groups, and find the group numbers that you selected. Drag & Drop your name in one of the available groups. If none of your group options are free, you can contact the super TA for help.
