In this final assignment, you wrap up your group project. Note that this is worth 2x the amount of points of the other weeks' assignments

To that end, perform the relevant statistical analyses on the results of last week's user study and compile appropriate data visualisations (tables, graphs, ...) to be included in the final version of your project report. Collect all the material for your prototype and the other materials and write a final report. In this final report you can reuse (corrected versions of) any of the documents you produced in the previous weeks. Make sure that the project report is self-contained, ie. understandable by someone who has not followed your project. Use the structure as outlined in Chapter 8.2 of the book.

**Question 1. Project prototypes and materials** (30 points). Provide a zip file that contains all the working documents (e.g., notes, drawings, mockups, screenshots, interviews, code...) developed through the weekly group assignments, and improved after collected feedback from your TAs and peers. Also include a readme.txt file in the zip root that explains the contents of your zip file. These should include:

- **Use Case Definition**: Working documents (e.g., written notes, drawing, tables) describing the user tasks, profiles, and information needs
- **Prototyping & Experimentation**: Low-fidelity prototypes (e.g., screenshots, drawings) at different stages of the design process.
- **Design Rationales**: Text explanations discussing how the prototypes address the user needs, the advantages and disadvantages of the design alternatives developed during the project, and concluding with ideas for relevant user study.

**Question 2. Project report**Â in written form (70 points). Write a report (~5-10 pages pdf document, _named groupX_project.pdf_ to be _included in the zip file_) that discusses the use case, the design issues, the potential solutions, the final implementation, the experiments done (also discuss your pilot if you think this is useful), the results, including the statistical analysis and results visualisation and reflection and propose future improvements. Use the structure as outlined in Chapter 8.2 of the book:

**Important:** In the final project report, also include a section: **Justification,** where _each group member_ describes their main input into the project. What did you focus on, how did it contribute to the whole. We expect that each group member has a _significant_ input in the project.
