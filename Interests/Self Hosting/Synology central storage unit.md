While the search results don't provide a specific tutorial for setting up a Synology NAS as central storage for services like Immich and Plex, I can provide you with a general guide on how to achieve this setup:

1. Initial Synology NAS Setup:
Follow the basic setup instructions for your Synology NAS, as outlined in the search results[1][3]. This includes:
- Installing hard drives
- Connecting the NAS to your network
- Installing DSM (DiskStation Manager)
- Creating storage pools and volumes
- Setting up user accounts and shared folders

2. Configure Network Settings:
- Set a static IP address for your NAS to ensure consistent access[4]
- Configure port forwarding on your router if you need remote access

3. Create Shared Folders:
- Create dedicated shared folders for your services (e.g., one for Plex media, one for Immich data)[3]
- Set appropriate permissions for these folders

4. Install Plex on your computer:
- Download and install Plex Media Server on your main computer
- During setup, point Plex to the shared folders on your Synology NAS for media storage

5. Set up Immich:
- Install Immich on your main computer
- Configure Immich to use the designated shared folder on your Synology NAS for photo storage

6. Mount NAS Shares on Your Computer:
- Use SMB or NFS to mount the Synology shared folders on your main computer[3]
- This allows your services to access the NAS storage as if it were local

7. Configure Backups:
- Use Synology's built-in backup tools to create snapshots or backups of your data[4]
- Consider setting up external backups for additional data protection

8. Security Considerations:
- Enable firewall and security settings on your Synology NAS[4]
- Use strong passwords and consider enabling two-factor authentication

9. Performance Optimization:
- If needed, consider using SSD cache on your Synology NAS to improve performance for frequently accessed files[2]

Remember to consult the specific documentation for Plex and Immich for any service-specific setup requirements. While this guide provides a general framework, you may need to adjust some steps based on your particular Synology model and the specific requirements of the services you're running.
