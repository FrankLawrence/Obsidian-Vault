### Lyrics
Speech has allowed the communication of ideas
Enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible
Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking
Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future
With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded

All we need to do is make sure we keep talking
