- Larry wants attention, but does not seem to realize it will not help him make friends
- He is naive: he takes people at face value, even when they are just laughing at him
	- He does not suspect that Cindy may have an ulterior motive
	- Cindy is using Larry
	- Larry only wanted to protect Cindy: instead, he ends up taking the blame
- He feels empathy with monsters because that is how other people see him
  > "all monsters were misunderstood"
- Wallace is the first friend Larray has had since Silas
- He does not realize that he cannot help Wallace
- Silas effectively ruined Larry's life
