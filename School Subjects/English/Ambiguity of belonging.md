- seems to be the typical representative of an American blue-collar worker:
  house in a (formerly) white neighborhood, family, no financial hardship, job in a traditional industry (Ford Motor Company), proud of his work ethics, a symbol of Detroit's glorious past, self-reliant, active
- part of the Polish-Catholic community

	  -> as a war veteran: faces and accepts his past
- Is he succesful in the end with achieving a sense of belonging?
