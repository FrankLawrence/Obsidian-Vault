## Experience with troubleshooting
I've used troubleshooting in the past to find bugs in code, find issues during a math problem aswell as when taking pictures...
## Pictures turn out black problem
Problem: When taking a picture, the picture would turn out black.
The following list shows a hierarchy of hypotheses, their tests, and results.
Between each test, I would take another picture and look at the results.

- An object is blocking the view of the sensor
	- The lens cap is still on -> check if the cap is on -> False
	- ND Filter is darkening the image -> check for filters attached to lens -> False
	- An object is blocking the sensor directly -> detach lense and look into the camera case -> False
- The settings of the camera are wrong -> go through the camera settings
	- ISO setting to low -> increase sensor sensitivity -> False
	- Apeture is too small
		- increase apeture diameter -> False
		- change lense -> False
	- Shutter speed is too high -> shorten shutter speed -> Hypothesis validated
