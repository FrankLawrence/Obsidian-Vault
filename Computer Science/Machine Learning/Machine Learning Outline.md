Machine Learning is the practice of creating computer programs that learn from data. In this course, you will learn the basic principles, methodology and algorithms of machine learning.

Please read this page from top to bottom before asking any questions (note the FAQ section). Questions should be asked by on [the Discussion board](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/discussion_topics "Discussions"), to your teaching assistant or, failing that, by email to Peter Bloem (details below).

**Please don't use the Canvas messaging system, you will not get a reply.**

### Schedule

This course is taught through pre-recorded lectures. The videos will be discussed in live lecture sessions twice a week. You can join these in-person or over zoom. Attendance is not obligatory.

The first lecture each week is on **Monday at 11:00**, the second is on **Thursday at 11:00**. All lectures are in **MF-FG1**. The password for [the zoom session Links to an external site.](https://vu-live.zoom.us/j/97045669754?pwd=69a1rkPEhagEdfsY8QHnazr5rL3hrt.1) is always `wall-e`.Â 

In addition, there is one homework session and one project group session per week, please see [the schedule details](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/pages/schedule-details "Schedule details") for time and location. For homework sessions there are a few online options, project sessions are always on-campus.

### Course requirements

The course has two parts. One **group project** and an **examination** which consists of **4 online quizzes** and a **final exam**. Your examination grade is based on the total number of points scored for the quizzes and the exam together.

In order to pass the course, you need to do the following:

- Pass the **examination** with a 5.5 or higher.
- Complete **theÂ  project** (in a group of 5 students) and hand in a report scoring a 4.5 or higher.

The final grade is the average of these two, which should be higher than 5.5 to pass.

You get 40 points for the quizzes and 40 points for the exam. This means that 80 points corresponds to a 10 for the examination. **The minimum points required to pass is 52 points.** This corresponds to a 5.5 for the examination. The rest of the grades are assigned linearly along this scale, leading to the following mapping:

| **points** | **examination grade** |
| --- | --- |
| 45 | 4.4 |
| 50 | 5.2 |
| 55 | 6.0 |
| 60 | 6.8 |
| 65 | 7.6 |
| 70 | 8.4 |
| 75 | 9.2 |
| 80 | 10.0 |

For more details, see the page [On grading and feedback](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/pages/on-grading-and-feedback?wrap=1 "On grading and feedback").

If you would like to reuse a grade from a previous year, see the FAQ below for details.

There is one resit for the exam in the summer. There will be a retake opportunity for each quiz at the end of the course, but be advised that using these means a cap on your examination grade of a 7 (only the quiz retake leads to a cap, retaking the final exam does not lead to a cap).

In order to help you achieve these goals, there will be *lectures*, *work groups* and *project sessions*.Â **Attendance is not compulsory for any of these**, except that at least one member of your group should be present at every project session.

- **Lectures** are pre-recorded and available as youtube videos and as written lecture notes. These will be discussed in live lecture sessions twice a week. You can join in-person or on Zoom.
- **Homework groups** are given by teaching assistants. Each week, there is a homework assignment, which you are expected to complete before the work group. The teaching assistant will then work through the exercises on the blackboard. The homework is not compulsory, and will not be graded: it is purely an opportunity to practice the practical questions of the exam and of the quiz.
- The **project sessions** are also held weekly. You will join together with other groups and give informal presentations on the progress of your project. Each group should present at every session, but not all members have to be present. A teaching assistant is present to answer questions, and to comment on the project progress. There is no project session in the first week. In the last project session (the week before the exam), attendance is optional and a presentation is not required.
- We also provide some **worksheets** to help you get started with machine learning in python. We strongly recommend python for the project, but other languages or platforms are allowed. The worksheets are not complete tutorials, but they should give you a basic starting point.

You can self-register for both the work groups and the project groups. Go to *[People](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/users "People") > Groups* and look for "Homework group" or "Project group".

If you are confident that you can manage the homework on your own, or you'd prefer to just ask questions on the discussion board, you don't need to register for a homework group.

### Examination

#### The Quizzes

There are four small Canvas quizzes that you should finish. The deadline for each is Friday at midnight, and they cover the material of the previous week. The quizzes are designed to take around 60 minutes, assuming that you have practiced the relevant homework exercises and studied the relevant lectures. There is no time limit except for the deadline.

The questions will be randomly picked from a question bank, so no two quizzes will be the same.

There will be a retake opportunity for each quiz at the end of the course, but be advised that using one or more of these means a cap on your *examination grade* of a 7.

*That is, we will replace the score of your quiz with the score of the retake quiz, combine it with the exam to compute an examination grade, and if this grade is higher than 7, you will get a 7. This 7 will then be averaged with your project grade, which can be above 7, to compute your final score.  
*

Once you open a retake quiz, it will be submitted and the cap will apply, so do not open the retake unless you are sure you want to retake. If you open one by accident, do not fill in any of the questions, and let us know.

#### The Exam

[**Download the formula/cheat sheet.**](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/files/8514905/download?wrap=1 "cheat-sheet.pdf") [Download Download the formula/cheat sheet.](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/files/8514905/download?download_frd=1)

The exam covers material from **the lectures**, from **the required reading**, and from **the homework**. The focus will be on the material covered in the lectures, in the way that it is covered in the lectures. However, things mentioned in the reading but not in the lectures may occur in the exam.

The exam consists of 40 *multiple choice questions*, each with four possible answers, of which only one is correct. One third of these will be simple **recall** of knowledge, one third will require you to **combine** knowledge, and one third will require **application** of knowledge, like computing a function or algorithm.

The homework sessions will prepare you for the application category. In this category, there are ten question types from which the questions will be drawn. The structure of a question type is always the same, with only details changes. In short, if you practice each of the ten question types, syou will not be surprised by what you see on the exam. See practice Exam A (the PDF file) for a more detailed explanation.

Here are two practice exams:

Under quizzes, you will also find a *Canvas* practice exam. This is automatically generated from a large question bank, so you can take it multiple times.

The exam is done on pen and paper. Location information is linked in the schedule above. The exam is closed-book. The formula sheet linked above contains all the formulae you'll need. You should print it out and bring it with you. **The formula sheet also contains a box in which you may write whatever you like, so long as it it written by hand.  
**

### The Project

The project is done in groups of 5. There is one deliverable: a report of max 10 pages. The report should be written as much as possible in the style of a research paper (no coversheet, proper references). The report is due at midnight on the last Friday of the course.

To get you started with programming for the report, we offer a few **worksheets** (jupyter notebooks) in the first weeks. It is highly recommended that you follow these, and build on them in your project.

We have [some example reports available](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/pages/sample-project-reports "Sample project reports") from previous years, to give you an idea of what we're looking for. The report should include an information sheet ([docs Links to an external site.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k1JpEU4EFKrBw16BRbklRcUPqbNXw7SIoyCsnIBu0IQ/edit?usp=sharing), [latex Links to an external site.](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zgykyqpzqvwb#dd20b9)) containing some details about your group and the tools you used.

#### Project meetings

Every week (except the first and last), you will have a project meeting, where at least one member of your group should be present, and present something, using one or two slides. These presentations are **informal**. They will not be graded, and you should not prepare too much, **but you are required to use slides**. Just make sure that you have something to show for the past week of work. Things you can present:

- A list of candidate subjects that you are thinking about tackling.
- A difficult problem that you haven't been able to solve (or one that you did manage to solve).
- Some related work you've found, and some aspects of it that you're having trouble understanding.
- An early investigation of your data, with some first plots.
- Some of the knottier problems of your chosen subject (class imbalance, high required compute power, missing data, little available data etc).
- An explanation of some part of a chosen model that you now understand (but didn't last week).

Ideally, these will lead to some discussion. You may be able to get some helpful tips from the teaching assistant chairing the meeting or from members of other groups. We're aiming for a *collaborative* atmosphere rather than a *competitive* one.

#### Subjects

In the first three weeks, you should try to complete the worksheets, get familiar with your tools, and look around for potential subjects. On **February 27**, you will finalize your choice of topic, and **post it in a pinned topic on your project group discussion board**. Your TA will give you some written feedback if they haven't done so already in person. This is a hard deadline, so don't forget.

You are free to choose the subject of the project yourself. See [the requirement page](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/pages/project-requirements-and-rubric "Project requirements and rubric") for some suggested topics.

#### Grading and requirements

The project is graded on a rubric.

**The rubric and the technical requirements [can be found here](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/pages/project-requirements-and-rubric "Project requirements and rubric"). You can submit the report [here](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/assignments/378542 "Final report submission").  
**

Please read the rubric carefully: it will tell you what to do to ensure a good grade.

In all written material (the report and the quizzes), the rule is that you may use AI tools to help you generate or understand ideas, but not to write text that you hand in directly as your own. You can also use the tool to get *feedback* on something you've written, but not to write for you.

**When you use an AI tool you should *always* include a line stating which tool you used and how. If done correctly, this will not in itself cost you points. If you omit it, it is considered fraud.** For the final report, there is an information sheet where you can declare this, in the quizzes, you should include a line in the answer itself.

If you use an AI tool without doing any work yourself, or if you fail to declare its use, [this is considered *fraud*](https://vu.nl/en/student/examinations/academic-integrity). While detection methods may be limited at the moment, they may develop in the future, and [fraud can be punished retrospectively if it's serious enough Links to an external site.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttenberg_plagiarism_scandal).

Finally, you may use copilot, or similar tools, to *help* you write code, but not to write code for you. However, we recommend that you don't. There is [strong evidence accumulating Links to an external site.](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/21/ai_assistants_bad_code/) that copilot leads to lazy programming, and poor code. You will learn a lot more if you write your code by hand, and read the documentation carefully.

*The rules on this will change from course to course. Don't assume that the same will be true in the next course you take.*

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the format of the live lectures? Do I need to watch the videos/read the notes beforehand?**

The primary aim of the live lectures is to answer questions you have about the material. You will get much more out of it if you at least skim the material before attending the lectures.

If there are no questions, the lecturer will simply go over the material again. They will not focus on covering all the material: they will pick out the important points, and take their time to answer questions.

This means that if you *only* attend the live lectures and never watch the videos or read the notes, you will not see all the exam material.

**I'm having trouble following the more technical/mathematical parts. Do I really need to understand all of this?**

In principle, you should try to, but if that doesn't work in the time you have available, there are some shortcuts. Have a look at [practice exam A](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/files/8514931?wrap=1 "practice-exam-a.noanswers.pdf") [Download practice exam A](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/files/8514931/download?download_frd=1) above. This outlines ten specific question types that you need to be able to answer. These are also the questions that the homework prepares you for. If you can do these, you can skip any other technical part in the lectures that you are struggling with, so long as you understand the larger message well enough to answer the recall and combination questions.

Note, however, that it's very likely that the courses you will take after this course, will contain the same level of mathematical density (especially if you will go to the master next year). So, if you don't take this opportunity to get used to the mathematics, you will only struggle more in the future.

**I have a question that is not answered here. Whom do I ask?**

If your question is about course content or general administration, please ask on the discussion board. If your question is personal or otherwise not of general interest, please ask your TA. Your TA is the one who supervises the project sessions of your project group. If you're not in a project group, you may pick any TA. The TAs will pass any questions they can't answer on to the coordinator.

If your question is too personal to discuss with a TA, feel free to contact the coordinator directly.

Please communicate with us **over email** and not through the Canvas messaging system.

**Is it possible to record the live lectures?**

No. These sessions are specifically intended to provide an informal atmosphere, where both the lecturers and the students can speak freely. There is no obligation to attend the live lectures. If you can't attend and you have questions, please use the discussion board.

**Can we make a group of 6 people?**

No, sorry.

A solution that is often taken is to break up into two groups of 3 (rather than kick one person out). These can then each attract 2 new members to complete the group.

**Can I do the project by myself, or with a smaller group?**

In principle, no.

More specifically, the rule is that there is a fixed number of groups, and anybody can join any group that still has places available. This means that you can be in a group by yourself, or make a group with fewer than five people, but there's no way to guarantee that it'll stay that way.

If you do end up with fewer than 5 people, you will get some compensation in the grading.

**I can't find a group that will take me and it's getting late in the project.**

You are allowed to join any group that still has spots open. At the start of the course, you should be nice, and leave again if people indicate that they are still waiting for a specific person to join. However, they cannot kick you out because they'd rather do the project with 4 people.

In short, if you don't have a group in the second week, just join any group that still has space left, introduce yourself on the group discussion board and ask what you can do to help (you'll have to accept that they may have already made some decisions without you).

Conversely, if you don't like the idea of a random person joining your group, make sure you get 5 people of your choice together. If your group has fewer than 5 people, you cannot kick people out when they join.

**Can I do a resit for the project?**

No. There is no resit available for the project. If you get a 4.5, you can still pass if your exam grade is high enough to average at 5.5. If you get lower than a 4.5, you'll have to take the course again next year. Make sure to have a look at [the rubric](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/pages/project-requirements-and-rubric "Project requirements and rubric"), it tells you what to do to avoid this scenario.

**I took the course earlier, and passed one part but not the other, can I re-use my project or exam grade?**

Yes, but only if your partial grade is one or two years old (from Feb 2023 or Feb 2024). If your grade is older than that, you'll have to do both the project and the exam.

**Please fill in [this form Links to an external site.](https://forms.gle/r719BJgxfaEXnZWi7)** **to let us know you'd like to reuse an old grade.**

**I have passed the exam already, do I still need to do the quizzes? What if I passed the report already?**

The parts you can reuse are *the exam together with the quizzes* or the report. You cannot reuse the points you got for the quizzes and redo the exam, or redo the quizzes and reuse the points you got for the exam.

In short, you can reuse grades, but you cannot reuse *points*.

**If I fail one part of the course, but not the other, can I re-use the other grade next year?**

Most likely yes, although we cannot fully guarantee this (there is a small chance the course content will change too much, or a different coordinator will take over who will set new rules).

If the current rules hold, a partial grade remains valid for two years. For example, if you fail the examination this year (2025), but not the project, you can pass next year (2026) and the year after (2027) by taking the examination, reusing your project grade from 2025. If you retake the course in 2028, you'll have to redo both the examination and the project.

The quizzes count as part of the examination. Passing only the quizzes or only the written exam does not give you anything you can re-use next year.

**The lecture notes sometimes differ from the videos. Will I miss exam content if I watch only the videos or read only the notes?**

No, either is sufficient to pass the exam. The only difference is that the lecture notes may contain a little extra explanations, and some further examples. If you don't understand the videos it's a good idea to see if the lecture notes offer anything extra, but if you're confident you've understood the videos, then you don't need to read the lecture notes.

**What is the policy for group disagreements?**

You are each individually responsible for making sure the members of your group stay motivated and provide good work. This is one of the learning goals of project-based work, so getting this wrong will cost you in your grade just as much as getting something wrong in the code or in the report.

So, make sure from day one that everybody is excited about the chosen subject, and that everybody is on the same page about the level of ambition in the project. There will not be different grades for different members of the group.

We will not allow you to exclude members of the group based on (perceived) lack of work. Either everybody gets the same grade, or nobody gets a grade. If you do end up having a serious dispute, or a group member has simply stopped responding, **bring it to our attention early**, so that we have time to hear both sides of the story. If the first we hear about it is in the last week of the course, we cannot do anything about it.

**One of our group members has quit the course.  
**

Please inform your TA. They will make a note of it, and you will be compensated in your grading. The group member may still take the exam, if they want to, but they will not get a grade for the project.

**One of our group members is not showing up to meetings or responding to emails.**

Please email your TA about this *early* in the course. They will send the non-responsive group member a message. If the group member doesn't respond to this either, you can exclude them from the group. If they do, you'll have to work together to find a way for them to make up the lost time.

**I can't make it to my work group this week. Can I join another work group just this once?**

Yes. In fact, there is no need to ask permission for this, you can always sit in on another workgroup if you need to. Please do this only if there's a good reason, so that we keep the group sizes roughly balanced.

**Nobody in our group can make it to the project group this week. Can we present at another project group this week?**

This is fine, so long as both TAs are informed beforehand and agree. Please do this only as a last resort.

**We would like to use the weekend after the exam week to finish up the project. Can the project deadline be moved to Monday?**

No. However, there is a *grace period* over the weekend. This means that it's possible to hand in late until Monday noon. Doing so will cost you approximately one "poor" in [the rubric](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/81035/pages/project-requirements-and-rubric "Project requirements and rubric") for every 24 hours you're late, so you should consider carefully whether you want to do this, but it may be worth it in certain cases.

You can hand in a provisional version on time, and then hand in a second version late. In such cases, we will always grade the most recent submission (unless you ask us not to).

**Why won't you move the deadline? What difference does it make?  
**

The course period ends on Friday, and this is the last moment we can require you to work on the course. We have an obligation to the lecturers in period 5 not to eat into their time by setting deadlines outside of our period. That includes ensuring that students have had a weekend's rest between our course and theirs.

Moreover, the TAs are hired for one week after the course ends, and we have many reports to grade. Since we all have other obligations, some of us need to start grading during that weekend in order to have the whole course graded on time.
