- Young people share personal information, rarely changing privacy settings [p.299]
- Young people's concerns about their privacy is due to their different understanding, not how much they value their privacy [p.300]. They care more that they keep secret their data from people closest to them, not strangers or cooperations[p. 301]
- adolescents find that their relationships are more important to privatise than their personal information. [p. 301, 304]
- Freedom, Security and privacy are often seen as opposing forces, where freedom and security are preferred [p.302, 307], but also deemed not as concerning [p.307] (people willingly give up privacy for freedom, but "do not disregard it entirely" [p. 309].
- people show more concern towards privacy when it is about personal information (usually adults [p.304]), and the other way around
- adolescents are less concerned, but still find privacy important (since they don't see online personal information as a "threat" as adults do) [p. 306]
- adolescents don't value things such as freedom, privacy or security as too much of threats compared to adults (this is a development trait and could be due to their lesser understanding of the consequences of online personal information)
