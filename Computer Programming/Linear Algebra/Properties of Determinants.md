> [!info] THEOREM 3
> **Row Operations**
> Let $A$ be a square matrix.
> 1. If a multiple of one row of $A$ is added to another row to produce a matrix $B$, then $\text{det }B=\text{det }A$
> 2. If two rows of $A$ are interchanged to produce $B$, then $\text{det }B=-\text{ det }A$
> 3. If two rows of $A$ is multiplied by $k$ to produce $B$, then $\text{det }B=k\text{ det }A$
