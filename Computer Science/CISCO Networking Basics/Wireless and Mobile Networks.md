# Wireless Networks

**Global Positioning System**
The GPS uses satellites to transmit signals that cover the globe. The smartphone can receive these signals and calculate the phoneâ€™s location to an accuracy of within 10 meters.

**Wi-Fi**
Wi-Fi transmitters and receivers located within the smartphone enable the phone to connect to local networks and the internet. In order to receive and send data on a Wi-Fi network, the phone needs to be within the range of the signal from a wireless network access point. Wi-Fi networks are usually privately owned but often provide guest or public access hotspots. A hotspot is an area where Wi-Fi signals are available. Wi-Fi network connections on the phone are similar to the network connections on a laptop computer.

**Bluetooth**
Bluetooth is a low-power, shorter range wireless technology that is intended to replace wired connectivity for accessories such as speakers, headphones, and microphones. Bluetooth can also be used to connect a smartwatch to a smartphone. Because Bluetooth technology can be used to transmit both data and voice, it can be used to create small local networks. Bluetooth is wireless technology that allows devices to communicate over short distances. Multiple devices can be connected at the same time with Bluetooth.

**NFC**
Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless communication technology that enables data to be exchanged by devices that are in very close proximity to each other, usually less than a few centimeters. For example, NFC can be used to connect a smartphone and a payment system. NFC uses electromagnetic fields to transmit data.
# Bluetooth
Mobile devices connect using many different methods. Cellular and Wi-Fi can be difficult to configure, and require extra equipment such as towers and access points. Cable connections are not always practical when connecting headsets or speakers. Bluetooth technology provides a simple way for mobile devices to connect to each other and to wireless accessories. Bluetooth is wireless, automatic, and uses very little power, which helps conserve battery life. Up to eight Bluetooth devices can be connected together at any one time.

These are some examples of how devices use Bluetooth:

- **Hands-free headset** - A small earpiece with a microphone can be used for making and receiving calls.
- **Keyboard or mouse** - A keyboard or mouse can be connected to a mobile device to make input easier.
- **Stereo control** - A mobile device can connect to a home or car stereo to play music.
- **Car speakerphone** - A device that contains a speaker and a microphone can be used for making and receiving calls.
- **Tethering** - A mobile device can connect to another mobile device or computer to share a network connection. Tethering can also be performed with a Wi-Fi connection or a cable connection such as USB.
- **Mobile speaker** - Portable speakers can connect to mobile devices to provide high-quality audio without a stereo system.
