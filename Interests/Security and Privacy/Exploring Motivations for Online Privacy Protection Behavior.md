- personal information can be used in a variety of fields (website usability, convenience, personalised products) with the effect of less informational privacy [p.945]
- people are concerned with the use of their personal information from cooperations (governing and commercial) [p.954]
- privacy protection laws shift the responsibility onto the users themselves, which have to be well informed, and capable of making "rational and educated decisions" [p.954] -> more effective privacy laws 
- protective behaviours are "specific computer-based actions that consumers take to keep their information sage" [2,p.450]
- **RQ1**: To what extent do people protect their online privacy? And, which methods are used most often?
- people who care deeply about their personal data are more likely to act in a more privacy protecting manner [3,4,5]
- people with more technical knowledge are more likely to engage in this behaviour [3,4,6,7]
- "The privacy calculus model suggests that people decide how much they want to disclose about themselves based on the perceived benefits (e.g., self-expression) and the perceived costs (e.g., privacy concerns): When the benefits outweigh the costs, people are usually more inclined to disclose information." [1, p.957]
- **Threat appraisal**: A threat to one's privacy exists when someone else is in control over what, when, where and how personal data is shared
	- *perceived severity*: "an individuals belief about the seriousness of the threat" [p.958]
	- **H1**: Higher levels of perceived severity of online privacy threat will lead to more protective behavior
	- *perceived susceptibility*: "an individual's belief about his or her chance of experiencing the threat" [p.958]
	- **H2**: Higher levels of perceived susceptibility to online privacy threats will lead to more protective behavior
- **Coping Appraisal**: 
	- *Self-efficacy*: if a person thinks they can make the correct decision to protect their online privacy [p.959]
	- **H3**: Higher levels of self-efficacy will lead to more protective behavior
	- *response efficacy*: does the person think their action helps keep their personal information safe [p.959]
	- **H4**: Higher levels of perceived efficacy of protective behavior will lead to more protective behavior
- having more knowledge of the subject of cookies and data collection (one's education) has shown to increase privacy protection [3,6]
- **RQ2**: Do people's (1) education, (2) gender, and (3) age influence privacy protective behavior
- people "rarely to occasionally protect their online privacy" [p.963]
	- most people delete cookies, delete their browser history or decline cookies (more that 60% at least occasionally do so)
	- **many people do not know what to answer** -> not well informed
- "people perceive the collection, usage, and sharing of personal information online as a sever problem to which they are susceptible" -> perceived threat to online privacy high
- people don't have much trust in themselves that they can prevent tracking, but do believe that some actions do prove to keep their online information more private
- "perceived severity and response efficacy have a small positive effect on people's behavior" -> H1 & H4
- "perceived susceptibility and self efficacy have don not seem to effect people's behavior" -> H2 & H3 not supported
- **Education, gender and age don't have a significant effect on protective behavior**
- the more educated someone was, the less likely they are to respond with "do not know" -> lesser education influences one's protective behavior [1,8]
- People with less knowledge on the subject/matter of online data collection and protection are also seen to be less confident in their own actions to protect online information [p.968]
- "perceived response efficacy significantly predicts protective behavior" [p.968]
- To promote privacy protective behavior, you need to educate people about how collection, usage and sharing of personal data can be a threat to one's privacy
- Even a person with a *low confidence* can be motivated by presenting tools and methods that are **perceived as effective**
- We need **easy-to-use** privacy protection tools
