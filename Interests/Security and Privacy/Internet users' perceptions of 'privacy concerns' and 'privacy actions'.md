- privacy consists of *three dimensions*: Informational, accessibility and expressive privacy[^3]
- offline privacy concerns appear to be magnified online[^4]
- unprompted survey can provide the most accurate data[^5]
- relationship between privacy concern and gender of respondent was not statistically significant
- relationship between privacy concern and the age of respondent was found to be statistically significant
- The results of the discriminant analysis suggest that **Age is the best predictor** of whether people are concerned about their privacy whilst they are using the Internet, and the older users are, the more likely they are to be concerned

| Common reasons for no concerns | % of respondents |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| IT experience                  | 23.1             |
| Not caring                     | 17.4             |
| Nothing to hide                | 15.7             |
| Not knowing                    | 11.6             |
| Asking 'Why? Should I be?'     | 4.1              |
| Had no problems before         | 3.3              |

- The more hours users spend on the Internet a week, and the more years users have been using the Internet, the more likely they are to take actions to protect their privacy
- Respondents stated "I don't care about it [privacy]"
- A large proportion of respondents reported they *did not know how to take action to protect their privacy*
- Many felt they were "safe enough"
- They *did not feel a need to* because they *thought they were already secure as their work takes action to protect their privacy*
- "there was nothing that they could do"
- The most common reason for not taking action was because they *did not know how to*
- Respondents may be considering the term 'privacy' as a wider concept than just informational privacy
- [Electronic Privacy Information Centre](https://epic.org/) provides advice about how to protect privacy
- Internet experience was the best predictor of whether respondents take actions to protect their privacy online
- "I never experienced a situation in which my privacy on the Internet has been disturbed" -> Internet experience is important
