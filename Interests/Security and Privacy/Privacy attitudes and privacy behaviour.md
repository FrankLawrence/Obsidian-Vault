- People value their online browsing history at 7 Euros [^1]
- **Privacy Paradox**: People are concerned about data collection of their personal information, but do not do anything to prevent it [^2] p.122
- **Privacy calculus Theory**: Individuals weigh the *expected loss of privacy* against the *potential gain of disclosure* [^3] [^4]
	- Debatin et al. and Lee et al. confirm the appearance of the PCT [^5] [^6]
- social media users have become accustomed to sharing their information online, and see positive values in doing so: *self-clarification*, *social validation*, *relationship development*, *social control*, and *self-representation* [^6]
- Users would rather take the immediate benefits of belonging to a group, than rationally calculate the positives and negatives of disclosing personal information [^2] , p.128
- Optimism Bias heavily influences how people think that they are less likely, compared to others (especially adolescents), to reveal personal information [^2], p.129
- **Hyperbolic discounting**: When people make decisions about privacy protection for the future, they largely exaggerate. When making the decision, they discount the long term effects of privacy protection, and would rather choose immediate benefits [^2], p.130
