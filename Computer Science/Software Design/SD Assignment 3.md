# Implementation
In the implementation part of this project, i.e., Assignment 3, you implement a working system from the created models. All models have to be consistent with the implementation of the system. We also expect you to use the feedback from Assignment 2 to refine your models before you implement them.

The resulting system must be fully functional with respect to the basic usage of the modeled system. To prove that your system works, in addition to its source code, you have to provide also (i) a self-contained executable of the implemented system, e.g., all used libraries should be included in a single JAR file, no assumptions on the OS where the system is running and (ii) a 30-seconds demo video on YouTube in which you show an example execution of the system.

Your source code will be analysed using the default configuration of SonarLint and we will count the total number of raised issues with the default Java configuration. You can use SonarLint issues for quickly spotting code smells in your project. SonarLint issues will not impact your final grade. Nevertheless, the top-5 teams in terms of number of SonarLint issues will get a bonus of 0.5 grades in Assignment 3.
