# Login scripts
- ```/.profile``` – executed automatically for all login shells
- ```/.bash_profile``` – similar to ```.profile``` , but only runs for bash login shells
- ```/.bashrc``` and ```/.zshrc``` – executed automatically for all non-login bash or zsh shells (when you explicitly type bash or zsh on the command line or run a script that starts with ```#!/bin/bash```)
# Commands
