(Links:: [[Computational Thinking for Coders]])
In number theory, there are sequences of numbers that either reach (converge towards) a target number T, or else endlessly iterate in cycles, depending on the starting number S. The function nextNumber() computes the, well, next number in a given sequence.

For this assignment:
- Write pseudo code that, given S, T, and nextNumber(), prints whether or not the sequence reaches T.
- Which (container) data structure is the most suitable for this problem?
