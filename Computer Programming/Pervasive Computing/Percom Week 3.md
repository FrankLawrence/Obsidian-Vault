- PE1. What is an image histogram? Sketch an example.
	- An image histogram is a plot of the relative frequency of occurence of each of the permitted pixel values in the image against the values themselves
- PE2. What are morphological operations? Give two examples and explain their effect. 
- PE3. What is the frequency of a sinusoidal signal with a period of 5 sec?  
- PE4. Sketch the frequency spectrum of :
	- a. A sinusoidal signal with the frequency of 25 Hz.
	- b. The sum of a sinewave of 25 Hz and a sinewave of 50 Hz of the same amplitude.  
- PE5. What is the FFT? Sketch FFT algorithm as a black box, and identify its inputs and outputs.  
- PE6. We applied the FFT to a sampled signal with 1000 samples and sampling frequency Fs=8000Hz. What does the vector returned by the FFT contain? How long is this vector, and how many elements can we really use? What are the first and last elements? What is the distance between 2 adjacent elements? 
- PE7. What is a spectrogram? How can we plot it? Sketch a spectrogram for a 0,1 s-long 100 Hz periodic signal.  
- PE8. Write in pseudocode a rule-based classifier to distinguish an oil bottle from an orange in an image.
