> [!info] THEOREM 10
> Let $T:\Bbb R^{n}\to\Bbb R^{m}$ be a linear transformation. Then there exists a unique matrix $A$ such that $$T(x)=Ax\qquad\text{for all } x \text{ in } \Bbb R^{n}$$
> In fact, $A$ is the $m\times n$ matrix whose $j$th column is the vector $T(e_{j})$ where $e_{j}$ is the $j$th column of the identity matrix in $\Bbb R^n$: $$A=[T(e_{1})\quad \cdots \quad T(e_{n})]$$
