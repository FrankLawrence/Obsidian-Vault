# Disclaimers:
❗DISCLAIMER: This Kahoot! doesn't guarantee at all that (any of) the questions will be on your exam. Anything said by me today cannot be used as an argument when you get a question wrong on the exam. Use this Kahoot! as a way to genuinely practice by not just taking the answers for granted but asking yourself "why". Good luck!❗

Some of you said that the questions 31 and 34 on the Kahoot! might be wrong, so pay careful attention to those.

For any questions regarding the format and the grading system of your coming exam, please go to Canvas or reach out to one of the TA's or the prof. Because we as mentors can NOT know 100%.
