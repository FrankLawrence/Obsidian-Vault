# Utilitarian Calculus
- What options do I have?
- What costs/benefits for *everyone* involved?
- What are the probabilities?
- Calculate the expected value of all your options.
- Determine the highest: that's what you'll have to do.

-> Construct a matrix
For each effect, you assign values (which appear at first somewhat arbitrary). We focus on the differences between the values.

Utilitarian calculus is intuitive by weighing the costs and benefits of one's options, but also (sometimes) requires a lot of effort and time, which is why ultilitarians do not *always* apply it, but rather follow common norms.
It is widely applicable, but there are some topics which are more complicated (human rights).
# Privacy
- Prevention of harm: Information you share now might be used against you later
- Informational inequality: Usually citizens are not in a good position to see what their data is going to be used for
- Injustice/discrimination: Personal data might be used to discriminate against you
- Autonomy/human dignity: Mass surveillance threatens our private mental life
