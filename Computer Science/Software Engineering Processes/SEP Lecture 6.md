## Challenges in the release process
1. Communication and collaboration between developers and operations
	1. Developers don't consider the deployment environment
	2. Operations don't know how the system works
2. Conflict of interest
	1. Developers want to finish implementing fast
	2. Operations want to maintain stability
3. Manual work
	1. Manual testing
	2. Manual release creation
	3. Manual deployment environment configuration
4. Slow down the release process
5. Require too much effort
