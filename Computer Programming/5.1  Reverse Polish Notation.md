The Reverse Polish notation (RPN) or Polish postfix notation is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands.

Take a look at the following example to demonstrate this:
- Standard (infix) notation: (4 - 5) * 3
- Reverse polish notation: 4 5 - 3 *
Notice that as long as each operator has a predefined number of operands, no parentheses are needed in RPN. Letâ€™s say you are writing a program that can evaluate such expressions. The program takes as input a stream of characters, denoting a string in Reverse Polish notation, and outputs the result of the expression.

1. Which data structure would be most appropriate for this task?
2. Give a pseudocode implementation of your program.
