# Homework groups

**warning: if no people are registered for a group, the TA will not be there. If you change groups for one week, make sure the group has members, or change your registration and warn the TA.**

The time of the workgroup session is the same each week, but the location may change. There is a workgroup every week except for the week of the exam.

Some of these times may overlap with your other classes. Please check before you register with a group. For one-time clashes, you are always free to switch to another workgroup for one week, so long as the room is not over capacity.

# Project groups

You will have six weekly group meetings. **These will start in the second week,** and carry on  throughout the course. For each group, at least one person **must** be present, and give an informal presentation on the group's progress (with one or two slides).

**Note, this schedule was finalized on 27-01-2025, 13:00. If you have registered before, check if your time slot still holds.**
