# Friendship and betrayal
- It is unusual for someone like Larry to make friends with a black boy
- Larry feels a connection to Silas during the car ride 
- Larry feels betrayed because he has felt a real connection to another boy for the first time
  > "In the cafeteria Silas sat with a group of black boys, laughing with them, even talking now and again. A betrayal, to Larry. For hadn't Silas been his **doppelgänger**?"
  > – P.49f
- Larry leaves his gloves intentionally behind and teaches Silas how to use a gun
  -> shows how much he is putting into their friendship
- The summer with Larry left a lasting impression on Silas (Silas still remembers things Larry taught him)
- Larry and Silas have to keep their friendship a secret since their parents wouldn't approve
- Silas first encounters Cindy because Larry is trying to impress him
- Carl urging them to fight ultimately resulted in the end of their friendship
  The use of the racial slur is a betrayal in Silas's eyes
  Larry betrays Silas by showing the same racist attitude as other white people
- Silas intentionally never returns Larry's calls and pretends Larry isn't there
  -> Silas doesn't try to resolve the issue
- Silas hides their friendship and can't say if he was Larry's friend
  > "I didn't know what I was."
- Silas tries to atone for his betrayal by feeding the chickens, visiting his mother, and finding the real killer to stop Larry from confessing
- Wallace is incapable of returning the friendship Larry offers him
- Larry thinks that Wallace can improve and believes Wallace is looking for someone to look up to
- Wallace lacks kindness and empathy for others and is obsessed with the crimes he thinks Larry committed 
- Wallace betrays Larry by burying Tina Rutherford's body under the hunting cabin and tries to kill him
