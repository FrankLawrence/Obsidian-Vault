(Links:: [[Automata and Complexity]])
[[Finite Automata]] give rise to regular languages:
- They can be used for [[Pattern Recognition]] like using [[Regular Expressions]] or [[Regular Grammars]]

[[Pushdown Automata]] give rise to context-free languages:
- They can be used for [[Parsing]] (e.g. programming languages) and are equivalent to [[Context-free grammars]]

[[Turing Machines]] yield recursively enumerable languages and are used for general **computation**.

Automata are used in many fields:
- [[Number theory]]
- Formal Verification
- [[Compiler Construction]]
- [[Software Abstraction and Modelling| Software Modelling]]
- Hardware Design
- [[Parsing]]
- [[Pattern Recognition]]
- Theory of computation

Automata poses the question: What can computers do? Some problems are **undecidable** (e.g. [[Program Termination]], Post correspondence problem, [[Semantics of, and Translations into, Predicate Logic#Satisfiability, Validity, and Consistency|Validity in Predicate Logic]]) whilst others are [[NP-hard problems]].
