The latter questions will either be multiple choice or open questions.

**There will be no quantum computing (e.g. Simon's Algorithm) on the exam.**

- **Partial grading and partial solutions:**  
You will get immediate feedback and for most of these tasks there will be partial grading. Just like in the homework, some of the tasks (the tasks description mentions whether this is possible for a task) allow to submit partial solutions without loosing attempts as long as the partial solutions are correct.

For the automata drawing tasks, there will be a "Save" button which saves the automaton on the server without grading! Use this button from time to time especially when drawing large automata to prevent data loss in case of browser or server crashes.

Many of the exam tasks will be similar to the homework tasks. Some exam tasks will focus on proving or reasoning, these tasks are similar to the exercises treated in the exercise classes.
- Additionally, the following example exams give a good indication of what kind of questions and what level of difficulty to expect:
