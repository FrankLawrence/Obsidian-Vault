(Links:: [[Fundamental of TinyML]])
Tiny machine learning (TinyML) is a **fast-growing field of machine learning** technologies and applications including **algorithms, hardware and software** capable of performing **on-device sensor data analytics** (vision, audio, IMU, biomedical, etc.) at **extremely low power**, typically in the mW range and below, and hence enabling a variety of **always-on use-cases** and targeting **battery-operated devices**
